qBittorrent WebUI dark theme for no-stress configuration

## Requirements
Install a CSS extension for your browser, I use and recommend this one: https://github.com/ankit/stylebot (_Stylebot is a browser extension that lets you change the appearance of the web instantly._)

## How to setup
- Open StyleBot window
- select the "code" tab to insert plain css
- copy and paste the code you find in `dark.css` into the Stylebot input area
- Enjoy dark theme.

That's all folks.
